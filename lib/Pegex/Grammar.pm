=head1 SYNOPSIS

Define a Pegex grammar (for the Foo syntax):

    package Pegex::Grammar::Foo;
    use base 'Pegex::Grammar';

    use constant text => q{
    foo: <bar> <baz>
    ... rest of Foo grammar ...
    };
    use constant receiver => 'Pegex::Receiver';

then use it to parse some Foo:

    use Pegex::Grammar::Foo;
    my $ast = Pegex::Grammar::Foo->parse('my/file.foo');

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Pegex::Grammar is a base class for defining your own Pegex grammar classes. It
provides a single action method, `parse()`, that invokes a Pegex parser
(usually Pegex::Parser) for you, and then returns the kind of result that you
want it to. In other words, subclassing Pegex::Grammar is usually all you need
to do to create a parser/compiler for your language/syntax.

Pegex::Grammar classes are very simple. You just need to define a C<text>
property that returns your Pegex grammar string, or (if you don't want to
incur the compilation of the grammar each time) a C<tree> property which
returns a precompiled grammar.

You also need to define the receiver class or object that will produce a
result from your parse. 'Pegex::Receiver' is the easiest choice, as long as
you are satisfied which its results. Otherwise you can subclass it or define
something different.

=head1 PROPERTIES

There are 2 properties of a Pegex::Grammar: C<tree> and C<text>.

=over

=item tree

This is the data structure containing the compiled grammar for your syntax. It
is usually produced by C<Pegex::Compiler>. You can inline it in the C<tree>
method, or else the C<make_tree> method will be called to produce it.

The C<make_tree> method will call on Pegex::Compiler to compile the C<text>
property by default. You can define your own C<make_tree> method to do
override this behavior.

Often times you will want to generate your own Pegex::Grammar subclasses in an
automated fashion. The Pegex and TestML modules do this to be performant. This
also allows you to keep your grammar text in a separate file, and often in a
separate repository, so it can be shared by multiple programming language's
module implementations. See the src/ subdirectory in
L<http://github.com/ingydotnet/pegex-pm/>.

=item text

This is simply the text of your grammar, if you define this, you should
(probably) not define the C<tree> property. This grammar text will be
automatically compiled when the C<tree> is required.
