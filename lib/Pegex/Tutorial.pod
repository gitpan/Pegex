Tutorial::JSON]

This is a very in-depth tutorial of the creation of the module L<Pegex::JSON> (a JSON decoder that uses Pegex) and the thought that went into creating it. It covers almost all of the L<Pegex::Syntax> as well.

=item [Pegex

Tutorial::Calculator]

Pegex comes with an C<examples/> directory. One example is L<Pegex/examples/calculator.pl>. It's a simple precedence parser (and evaluator) for arithmetic expressions like this one:
    1 * (2 + 3) / (4 ^ 5 ^ 6 - -7)
