=head1 NAME

Pegex::Module - Base Class for Pegex Grammar Interface Modules

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    package MyLanguage;
    use Pegex::Base;
    extends 'Pegex::Module';

    use Pegex::Parser;

    has parser => 'Pegex::Parser';
    has grammar => 'MyLanguage::Grammar';
    has receiver => 'MyLanguage::AST';

    1;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The module in the Synopsis above is a complete language parsing module. It
just inherits from L<Pegex::Module>, and then overrides the C<grammar> and
C<receiver> attributes. L<Pegex::Module> provides the C<parse()> method.

=head1 XXX

At this point you must specify the C<parser> attribute as well. The
inheritance of this default is not working.
